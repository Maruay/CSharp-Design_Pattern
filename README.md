Design Pattern
===========================

<b>1. Creational Design Pattern</b>

These design patterns are all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

- <b>Abstract Factory</b>
Creates an instance of several families of classes
- <b>Builder</b>
Separates object construction from its representation
- <b>Factory Method</b>
Creates an instance of several derived classes
- <b>Object Pool</b>
Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use
- <b>Prototype</b>
A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
- <b>Singleton</b>
A class of which only a single instance can exist

<b>2. Structural Design Pattern</b>

These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

- <b>Adapter</b>
Match interfaces of different classes
- <b>Bridge</b>
Separates an object’s interface from its implementation
- <b>Composite</b>
A tree structure of simple and composite objects
- <b>Decorator</b>
Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
- <b>Facade</b>
A single class that represents an entire subsystem
- <b>Flyweight</b>
A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
- <b>Private Class Data</b>
Restricts accessor/mutator access
- <b>Proxy</b>
An object representing another object

<b>3. Behavioral Design Pattern</b>

These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.

- <b>Chain of responsibility</b>
A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
- <b>Command</b>
Encapsulate a command request as an object
- <b>Interpreter</b>
A way to include language elements in a program
- <b>Iterator</b>
Sequentially access the elements of a collection
- <b>Mediator</b>
Defines simplified communication between classes
- <b>Memento</b>
Capture and restore an object's internal state
- <b>Null Object</b>
Designed to act as a default value of an object
- <b>Observer</b>
A way of notifying change to a number of classes
- <b>State</b>
Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
- <b>Strategy</b>
Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
- <b>Template method</b>
Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
- <b>Visitor</b>
Defines a new operation to a class without change
